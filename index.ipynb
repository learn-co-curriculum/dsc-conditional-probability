    "## Events and Sample Space\n",
    "\n",
    "An **Event** is the outcome of a random experiment e.g. watching heads on tossing of a coin, or getting 3 after a dice roll are events.  We need to specify the sample space and the events to compute event probability. An event may also be collection of different events grouped together e.g. rolling a dice 4 times. A **Sample space** is a collection of every single possible outcome in a trial. As the number of trials increases, our sample space contains all the achievable outcomes. For example, sample space for random throw of a die is {1,2,3,4,5,6}. One of these will undoubtedly happen in the event of throwing a die. The sample space depicts each one of the conceivable outcomes that can happen when the experiment is performed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Events in a sample could be either **dependent** or **independent**. For two events P and Q, the chance that the occurring of event P doesn’t influence the occurring of event Q, these events are called as independent events. If the P occurrence of P is somehow dependent on occurrence of Q , P would be dependent on Q (think temporal data). \n",

However, if we saw a blue marble in the first trial, the probability of seeing a blue in second trial becomes 1/4 etc. In simple terms, the probability of seeing an event B  in the second trial depends on the outcome A of the first trial , OR, P(B) is **conditional** on P(A).\n",
